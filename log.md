# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on 2 Rust Plugins a simple Hello command and a SteamID Finder command. Just learning the ropes of making plugin.

**Thoughts:** It isn't too hard to make Rust Plugins and is quite enjoyable, cant wait to get to the exciting stuff.

### Day 2: January 3, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I decided to go back to an old Project and work on my PasswordManager. I am hoping to develop this into a fully functioning Electron app. I spent a bit of time sharpening up my CSS skills as well as converting it into SCSS so I can learn to use it. Right now just focusing on the UI and will be doing Backend password generation based on settings later.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy the front-end development workflow, however I am trash at SCSS/CSS üòÇ. With this project I am hoping to improve my SCSS and HTML skills. It can do your head in sometimes but once it gets working it feels amazing üòÅ

### Day 3: January 4, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on simple Password Generators in different Languages in which other Developers can chip in and add/change the code. My main goal for this project is the improve my programming skills in multiple languages. 
I also worked on my C# Skills a little more. I am following a Udemy Course for Unity Game Development. The Twitter bot is coming soon :)

**Thoughts:** C# isn't difficult but I sharpen my OOP skills. I think this project is a great way to improve these skills and would help me become a better dev.

### Day 4: January 5, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Wrote this a little late but I worked more on the Password Manager, I worked on the CSS of the buttons as well as started to develop the backend for the site.

**Thoughts:** CSS is definitely not easy but it getting easier. I love SCSS and how powerful it is.

### Day 5: January 6, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I researched up about keeping my password generator cryptographically secure. I rewrote the Math.random function has previously it was not secure and could be guessed. I have also started researching about making twitter bots.

**Thoughts:** Fun and interesting stuff to research, I would like to thank people in The Coding Den Discord for bringing this to my attention :D 
I am also starting my Diploma of Software Development today.

### Day 6: January 7, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a freelance service submission form for my site which now allows people to hire me. I still need to style it a bit nicer as right now it is the same button as Read More. I also need to style the form nicely. It took me a while to find a decent form submission library but I ended up choosing Formspree.

**Thoughts:** Formspree is really simple to set up and easily allows me to get form data in a nice way without having to do my own backend work.

### Day 7: January 8, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Was not very productive today as I was not on my PC much due to family commitments however I did manage to just make the HireMe link take you to a popup as well as doing a bit more of my Diploma.

**Thoughts:** Wish I had more time to work on things today as I wanted to start work on some unity games and rust plugins

### Day 8: January 9, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Wrote this the next day as I forgot to log it. I worked more on my Diploma in which I followed a tutorial and made a simple Dining app which is meant to teach you the basics of c#. I also did a bit of Unity in my udemy course (which I forgot to push lol)

**Thoughts:** Was pretty simple to go through due to my past experiences with c# however it was a good refresher. I am loving Unity more than unreal as well as loving c# and how I can just integrate my skills from the diploma to my unity workflow

### Day 9: January 10, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I did not do too much today and will not be doing too much over the next 3 days as I am doing my dive course which takes up the whole day. However I did manage to sneak in some time to continue following my Udemy course in which I learn about states.

**Thoughts:** I was pretty tired but managed to soak in some content as well as coming up with some cool game ideas ;) really enjoying the course and will learn about 3D once I have completed this course.

### Day 10: January 11, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I got some time to work on Text101 and completed that section in the udemy course. I didn't really make my own story for this as i am just wanting to learn the key concepts of Unity however I do have some awesome game ideas I am going to try and develop.

**Thoughts:** Again I had a long day so I was tired but I really love unity and I have some awesome ideas I am wanting to share with everyone.

### Day 11: January 12, 2020
**Today's Progress**: For the 12th, 13th and 14th I didn't get time to actually write up a log as I was busy doing my dive course and also had family commitments. However over this time in my free time I was able to go over my diploma. I probably won't post that code as it wasn't much.

**Thoughts:** Struggled to find time to do #100DaysOfCode however from the 15th I will be back into full swing!

### Day 14: January 15, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I just refactored some code on DrawMe as I am getting it ready for adding settings. I also followed some of Brackeys tutorials on making 2D games and tomorrow will also do my udemy course.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying unity, it is so simple. I am also excited to work on my DrawMe project as I have drawn a rough design of what I would like it to look like.

### Day 15: January 16, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I forgot to actually upload the log. Good job me. I worked on Unity and just learning a bit more about making 2d games as well as making a rust /give command

**Thoughts:** Making rust plugins is really fun and pretty simple, now i just gotta think of things to make.

### Day 16: January 17, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I am working on the 3D Unity course on udemy. I am loving it so far. I also switched to GitKraken because why not. I should probably make that twitter bot that posts all my commits.

**Thoughts:** I love unity and am excited to complete my first game. I also love GitKraken however the UI is very cluttered and in your face whereas Github Desktop is very simple and easier (maybe also because i use it more üòÇ)

### Day 17: January 18, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my twitter bot. It is not completed yet and right now only retweets sort of work. Tomorrow (19th) I will be away and may not be able to code however if i do i am going to try research into Github Hooks.

**Thoughts:** This whole process has been pretty easy to setup. I may want to change the values of the Paramaters of the bot so it doesnt spam aswell as making 2 different retweets, both popular and recent.

### Day 18: January 19, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my twitter bot again. Just mainly refactored the code as i didnt get time to do much else.

**Thoughts:** Refactoring code is so fun <3
