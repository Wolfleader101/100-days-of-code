# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on 2 Rust Plugins a simple Hello command and a SteamID Finder command. Just learning the ropes of making plugin.

**Thoughts:** It isnt too hard to make Rust Plugins and is quite enjoyable, cant wait to get to the exciting stuff.

### Day 2: January 3, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I decided to go back to an old Project and work on my PasswordManager. I am hoping to develop this into a fully functioning Electron app. I spent a bit of time sharpening up my CSS skills aswell as converting it into SCSS so i can learn to use it. Right now just focusing on the UI and will be doing Backend password generation based on settings later.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy the front-end development workflow, however i am trash at SCSS/CSS 😂. With this project i am hoping to improve my SCSS and HTML skills. It can do your head in sometimes but once it gets working it feels amazing 😁

### Day 3: January 4, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today i worked on simple Password Generators in different Languages in which other Developers can chip in and add/change the code. My main goal for this project is the improve my programming skills in multiple languages. 
I also worked on my C# Skills a little more. I am following a Udemy Course for Unity Game Development. The Twitter bot is coming soon :)

**Thoughts:** C# isnt difficult but i sharpen my OOP skills. I think this Project is a great way to improve these skills and would help me become a better dev.

### Day 4: January 5, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Wrote this a little late but i worked more on the Password Manager, i worked on the CSS of the buttons aswell as started to develop the backend for the site.

**Thoughts:** CSS is definetly not easy but it getting easier. I love SCSS and how powerful it is.

### Day 5: January 6, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today i researched up about keeping my password generator cryptographically secure. I rewrote the Math.random function has previously it was not secure and could be guessed. I have also started researching about making twitter bots.

**Thoughts:** Fun and interesting stuff to research, i would like to thank people in The Coding Den Discord for bringing this to my attention :D 
I am also starting my Diploma of Software Development today.

### Day 6: January 7, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today i worked on a freelance service submission form for my site which now allows people to hire me. I still need to style it a bit nicer as right now it is the same button as Read More. I also need to style the form nicely. It took me a while to find a decent form submission library but i ended up chosing Formspree.

**Thoughts:** Formspree is really simple to setup and easily allows me to get form data in a nice way without having to do my own backend work.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
